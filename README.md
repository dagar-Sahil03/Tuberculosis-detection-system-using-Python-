Introduction:
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health challenge, affecting millions worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in effective treatment and disease control. This project aims to develop a tuberculosis detection system using Python, leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze chest X-rays and accurately identify signs of tuberculosis.

Project Overview:
The developed system utilizes a dataset of chest X-rays labeled as normal or tuberculosis. Machine learning models are trained and tested on this dataset, focusing on optimizing accuracy and efficiency. The system's primary goal is to assist healthcare professionals in quickly and accurately diagnosing tuberculosis, facilitating prompt treatment and management.

Key Features:
-Dataset Utilization: Chest X-ray images labeled for tuberculosis detection.
-Machine Learning Algorithms: Implementation of algorithms to classify X-rays as positive or negative for tuberculosis.
-Accuracy Optimization: Training and testing models to ensure high accuracy in classification.
-User Interface: Command-line interface for simplicity and accessibility.

Benefits:

-Improved Diagnosis: Rapid and accurate identification of tuberculosis in chest X-rays.
-Enhanced Treatment: Facilitation of timely treatment initiation, improving patient outcomes.
-Public Health Impact: Contribution to global efforts in controlling TB spread through early detection.

Future Enhancements:
